### Qualified Mentors
Based on the given parameters, there are only 1,549 qualified mentors for the 72,458 roles that are about to open up.  Divided evenly, that would be about 46 mentees per mentor.  Of course, these mentees would likely be spread over the course of a few years, so it is potentially doable.  However, we need to know which departments these qualified mentors are in to determine if there are enough mentors for the opening positions.  The following table depicts the number of mentors per department.
